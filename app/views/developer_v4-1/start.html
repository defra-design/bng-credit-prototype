  <p>Use this service to record biodiversity gains in England. </p>

  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>register a biodiversity gain site</li>
    <li>record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Register a biodiversity gain site</h2>

  <p>Register biodiversity gain sites in England. The biodiversity units on the gain site can be used by development projects which need to meet at least 10% biodiversity net gain (BNG).</p>
  <p>Anyone who owns or leases land can register a biodiversity gain site. Someone can do it on the landowner's behalf if they have their consent to register.  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to register a biodiversity gain site</h3>

  <p>You'll need:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>consent from the landowner or leaseholder - if needed</li>
    <li>a planning obligation (S106 agreement) or conservation covenant securing the site for at least 30 years</li>
    <li>proof of ownership of the land</li>
    <li>a map showing the boundary of the biodiversity gain site</li>
    <li>a completed Biodiversity Metric 4.0</li>
    <li>a habitat management and monitoring plan</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To record biodiversity gains at the same time as registering a biodiversity gain site, you'll need the:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>planning references</li>
    <li>local planning authority for the development projects</li>
    <li>area and length of the habitats the development projects are using on the biodiversity gain sites</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once we have checked the biodiversity gain site and development project details we will add them to the public register. </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project</h2>

  <p>Development projects are legally required to use this service to record off-site gains. Any new development will need to meet at least a 10% biodiversity net gain.</p>
  <p>We will check the information you record. This is to avoid allocating the same habitat on a biodiversity gain site to multiple developers. You'll need to have written consent from the biodiversity gain site owners.</p>
  <p>Local planning authorities will not discharge a BNG pre-commencement planning condition until the off-site gains have been recorded.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll need to record off-site biodiversity gains for a development project </h3>

  <p>If you're using habitat on a registered biodiversity gain site.</p>

  <p>You'll need:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the Biodiversity Metric 4.0 file that your local planning authority reviewed with your Biodiversity Net Gain Statement</li>
    <!-- <li>the biodiversity gain site number for the off-site</li> -->
    <li>you'll need to have written consent from the biodiversity gain site owners</li>
  </ul>
