      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-bottom-3">What you need to do</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        In a moment you’ll be shown a mock up of an email from a Local Planning Authority. This relates to a planning application for a development at Emmers Green golf course that you've submitted. The planning application number for the development is 22/01976/RJL. Please make a note of this number as you will need it to complete the task.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Please read the email and follow the steps you need to take to buy credits. As you go through the steps, talk through what you’re doing.
