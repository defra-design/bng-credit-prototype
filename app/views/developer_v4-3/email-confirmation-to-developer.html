      <p>Dear {{ data['full-name'] or 'Jo Smith' }}</p>
      <p>Weâ€™ve added your biodiversity net gain details to the Public Biodiversity Gain Register for the following development project:</p>

      <p><strong>Project name:</strong>  Emmer Green Golf Course <br>
          <strong>Local authority:</strong> Reading Borough Council<br>
          <strong>Planning reference:</strong> 22/0197/RGL</p>

      <p><strong>Biodiversity gain site:</strong> Bex's Eco Farm Ltd <br>
        <strong>Biodiversity gain site number:</strong> BGS-12778902
      </p>

      <p>You can view your details on the Public Biodiversity Gain Register here: <a href="#">https://defra/bng-public-register.co.uk</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to discharge your BNG planning condition</h2>

      <p>You need to add this link to your Biodiversity Net Gain Plan and send it your local planning authority.</p>

      <p>You will not be able to discharge your BNG planning condition until the local planning authority has reviewed what has been recorded on the register, and they're happy you've met at least 10% net gain.</p>

      <p>Regards</p>
