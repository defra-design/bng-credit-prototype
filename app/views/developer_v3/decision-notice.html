          (3) Implementation of Approved Remediation Scheme<br><br>

          Any approved remediation scheme must be carried out in accordance with its terms prior to the commencement of development other than that required to carry out remediation, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Local Planning Authority must be given two weeks written notification of commencement of the remediation scheme works.<br><br>

          Following completion of measures identified in the approved remediation scheme, a verification report (referred to in PPS23 as a validation report) that demonstrates the effectiveness of the remediation carried out must be produced, and is subject to the approval in writing of the Local Planning Authority.<br><br>

          Informative Notes<br><br>

          Noise During Construction: Noise from construction and associated works has the potential to cause disturbance to neighbouring residents. In order to minimise this, this Authority would normally recommend that any work audible beyond the boundary of the site should only be carried out between the hours of 8.00am to 6.00pm on Mondays to Fridays and 8.00am to 1.00pm on Saturdays; there should be no noisy works carried out on Sundays or Bank Holidays. Best practicable means to prevent noise from the site should also be employed as defined in British Standard BS 5228 Part 1: 1984 (or its successors/revisions). Failure to keep these hours or to employ best practicable means to control noise could lead to the service of an enforcement notice under Section 60 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974. We would encourage applications for prior consent under Section 61 of the Act, particularly where the construction and/or demolition phase(s) may be prolonged or if work may be undertaken beyond the aforementioned hours. Please contact the Contact Centre (0121 704 8008) for further details.<br><br>

          Burning or Refuse on Demolition and Construction Sites: Because of the potential for nuisance to neighbours, burning of refuse prior to or during the construction phase is not generally acceptable and may be contrary to waste regulation legislation. if you do have special circumstances, such as a requirement to dispose of wood infected by disease or insects, please contact the Contact Centre (0121 704 8008) for further details.<br><br>

          Dust Control on Demolition and Construction Sites: Because of the potential for nuisance to neighbours and damage to property, reasonable steps to reduce dust emissions should be employed, particularly during any demolition works and in periods of dry weather.

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"><strong>Appeals to the Secretary of State</strong></h3>

      <p>If you are aggrieved by the decision of your local planning authority to refuse permission for the proposed development or to grant it subject to conditions, then you can appeal to the Secretary of State under Section 78 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.</p>

      <p>If this is a decision on a planning application relating to the same or substantially the same land and development as is already the subject of an enforcement notice, if you want to appeal against your local planning authority’s decision on your application, then you must do so within 28 days of the date of this notice.</p>

      <p>If an enforcement notice is served relating to the same or substantially the same land and development as in your application and if you want to appeal against your local planning authority’s decision of your application, then you must do so within: 28 days of the date of the service of the enforcement notice, or within 6 months [12 weeks in the case of a householder appeal] of the date of this notice, whichever period expires earlier.</p>

      <p>If this is a decision to refuse planning permission for a householder application, if you want to appeal against your local planning authority’s decision then you must do so within 12 weeks of the date of this notice.</p>

      <p>If this is a decision to refuse planning permission for a minor commercial application, if you want to appeal against your local authority’s decision then you must do so within 12 weeks of the date of this notice.</p>

      <p>If this is a decision to refuse express consent for the display of an advertisement, if you want to appeal against your local planning authority’s decision then you must do so within 8 weeks of the date of this notice.</p>

      <p>If this is a decision to refuse planning permission other than those specified above, if you want to appeal against your local planning authority’s decision then you must do so within 6 months of the date of this notice,</p>

      <p>If this is a decision to refuse permission for works to a TPO tree, if you want to appeal against your local authority’s planning decision then you must do so within 28 days of the date of this notice.</p>

      <p><strong>Appeals must be made using a form which you can get from the Secretary of State at Temple Quay House, 2 The Square, Temple Quay, Bristol BS1 6PN or online at https://www.gov.uk/appeal-planning-decision.</strong> </p>

      <p>The Secretary of State can allow a longer period for giving notice of an appeal but will not normally be prepared to use this power unless there are special circumstances which excuse the delay in giving notice of the appeal.</p>

      <p>The Secretary of State need not consider an appeal if it seems to the Secretary of State that the local planning authority could not have granted planning permission for the proposed development or could not have granted it without the conditions they imposed, having regard to the statutory requirements, to the provisions of any development order and to any directions given under a development order.</p>
